# Bangalore Housing Market Visualization

# Project Introduction
This project analyzes Bangalore housing prices using data visualization. The goal is to provide clear, data-driven insights for informed real estate decisions, transforming complex data into a compelling visual story. Explored price distribution, the impact of area and bedrooms, and location-based value.

# Data Source
The data for this project was obtained from the "Housing Prices Data in Metropolitan Areas of India" dataset on Kaggle.

# Methodology
The project involves transforming raw data into visual formats like charts, graphs, and a dashboard using Python packages. The visualizations are then interpreted to reveal insights and craft a data story that supports decision-making.

# Key Visualizations and Insights
* Distribution of Housing Prices (Histogram): The histogram is heavily right-skewed, indicating that a large number of properties are concentrated at the lower end of the price spectrum. This suggests a strong base of more affordable properties, with the luxury segment representing a much smaller portion of the market in terms of volume.

* Housing Price vs. Area (Scatter Plot): There is a clear positive correlation between Area and Price, as larger homes generally cost more. Most data points are clustered in the lower-left portion of the graph, indicating that a majority of properties are smaller in area and lower in price.

* Housing Price by Number of Bedrooms (Box Plot): The median housing price generally increases as the number of bedrooms rises from 1 to 5. Lower bedroom counts (1-3) show numerous high-priced outliers, indicating a segment of premium or luxury smaller properties.

* Top 10 Locations by Average Housing Price (Bar Chart): Richmond Town consistently has the highest average housing price, followed closely by Bannerghatta Road Jigani. This highlights the most premium and high-value residential areas.

* Correlation Heatmap: A moderate positive correlation exists between Price and Area, and a strong positive correlation between Area and the number of Bedrooms. The heatmap also shows a very weak negative correlation between Price and Resale.

* Average Price per Square Foot by Location (Bar Chart): Bannerghatta Road Jigani and Kalkere have the highest average price per square foot. Richmond Town, which had the highest average total price, is at the bottom of this list, suggesting that properties there are significantly larger on average.

# Actionable Insights for Decision-Making

* Buyers should focus on properties where the "Price per Sq Ft" is lower for the desired area.

* The total area of a property is a primary price driver.

* Land in locations with a high "Average Price per Sq Ft" should be prioritized for maximum return on investment.

* Amenities are good to attract buyers, but their direct impact on the sale price might be limited.
